applying pca on multispectral images .......
focused on applying PCA to a Multispectral Image within
Pakistan. Our desired location happens to be Thar Desert
and its surrounding areas. After obtaining, downloading, and
extracting the Multispectral image, we utilized 10 highly
detailed bands.
We applied basic operations on our chosen data set, such as
visualization, crop size and concatenation. After which we
implemented PCA on each band to reconstruct the image
without relying on built-in functions, and performed error
analysis..
